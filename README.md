# BMG-5111 (Breast cancer classification using artifical nerual network)

Our goal of this project is Implementing a web application to automatically detect breast cancer at an early stage using machine learning (ML) algorithms and to determine whether an individual's biopsy sample information indicates a benign or malignant tumor in the e-hospital website. Our method is based on getting the tumors' features dataset; here we use the Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset (WDBC); these features are derived from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNAC) of a breast mass to classify BC.

## Backend
To run the backend, run these commands inside the Backend folder:

```
npm install
npm start
```
Test the api's running using the below api in insomnia (an api testing tool):
http://localhost:3000/api/predictByModel

You can find a JSON example in backend folder to test the api.

## Frontend
To run the Frontend, you should install yarn first, then run these commands inside the Backend folder:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```
if the backend server is running, the website will be run on port 3001, you can enter the fields and submit it to see the results.
